## Welcome to the Gambers SMP website.

The Gambers SMP is a quirky SMP created and maintained by a group of my friends and I. My name is Travis, by the way. This website was made to catalogue our timelines, characters, events, and a ton of other things regarding the gambers. I'll be updating this website as we create more and more lore.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/travis-hehe/gambers-smp/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
